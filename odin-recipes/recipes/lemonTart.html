    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>What makes this Lemon Tart so perfect? It’s the lemon curd filling. </p>
    <p>It’s not too sweet but not mouth-puckeringly sour either, and so custardy it just melts in the mouth.</p>
    <p>This is a classic French tart that’s elegant and pretty as a picture, yet the filling is as simple as can be: just eggs, sugar, butter and fresh lemon!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the pastry</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g plain flour</li>
        <li>1140g icing sugar<li>
        <li>250g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>juice of 2 or 3 normal sized lemons</li>
        <li>140g caster sugar<li>
        <li>50ml double cream</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step1</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Rub the butter into the flour with your fingers until crumbly</li>
        <li>Mix in the egg yolks. If the pastry is still too dry, add 1-2 tbsp water until it comes together.</li>
        <li>Roll into a ball and divide in half (freeze one half for another recipe).</li>
        <li>Flatten out the pastry with your hands, wrap the dough in cling film, then chill for at least 30 mins</li>
        <li>While the pastry is chilling, make the filling. </li>
        <li>Beat all the ingredients, except for the zest, together.</li>
        <li>Sieve the mixture, then stir in the zest.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step2</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about the thickness of a £1 coin, then lift into a 23cm tart tin.</li>
        <li>Press down gently on the bottom and sides, then trim off any excess pastry.</li>
        <li>Stab a few holes in the bottom with a fork and put back in the fridge for 30 mins.</li>
    </ol>
